Symfony support policy
======================

As indicated by the contraints defined in the `composer.json` file, this bundle
supports Symfony `^2.8|^3.2`.

Only versions still actively maintained by the Symfony core team will be supported by
the maintainers of this bundle. Older versions of Symfony can be still used, but with older
versions of this bundle, so without active support.
If you want to get updates on old versions, you can do a Pull Request on the `1.4` branch
of this bundle, maybe it will be merged.
The same policy applies to old versions of PHP, out of active support: this bundle is actively
supporting PHP 7.0 (and newer versions).

You can check if a given Symfony version is still supported by visiting [their
Roadmap page](http://symfony.com/roadmap).

You can also check [supported versions of PHP](http://php.net/supported-versions.php).

## That was it!
